# diseaseSpreadModel
This program is a GUI simulator for a disease spread using a genetic algorithm.

## About
I built a program that simulates a disease spread in the population.
At the end of the run you get a graph of the iterations.

## Installing
- python and install the requirements.txt file.

## View:
The GUI looks like:

![Image of the opening](view_images/opening.png "opening")

![Image of the simulation](view_images/simulation.png "simulation")

![Image of the simulation graph](view_images/graph.png "solution graph")


The GUI is built with Python using library pygame.
The view includes:
* opening screen where you can choose the parameters for the simulation.
* the view of the spread of the disease in the population with a footer that indicate the iteration number, number of infected and healed.

## Run:
* pip install -r requirements.txt
* python main.py
